I used to believe that when the body was sick, it was purely a physical problem — not a problem of the mind.

But over time, through clinical experience, research, and life itself, I came to realize something different. In many cases, the body didn't break down first. **The mind began to waver, and that wavering eventually manifested as physical symptoms.**

So for a while, I concluded: we must heal the mind to restore the body.

But this conclusion didn't hold either.

## Emotions Are Not Entities — They Are Interpretations

When we look deeply at what we call "the mind" — our emotions and psychological states — they are not independent entities. They are closer to **the result of the brain interpreting signals from the body**.

How fast and regularly the heart beats, how deep or shallow the breath is, whether muscles are tense or relaxed, what sensory information rises from the skin, viscera, heart, and lungs — all of these bodily signals are integrated and interpreted by the brain, particularly the **insula** and the **salience network**, and we experience them as anxiety, calm, vitality, or exhaustion.

In other words, **the mind is not a conductor separate from the body. The mind is the product of interpreting the body's state.**

The answer to healing the mind, paradoxically, lies in the body.

## Perichoresis: Indwelling Without Separation

At this point, I want to borrow an ancient concept from theology: **Perichoresis** (περιχώρησις) — mutual indwelling.

Originally, this word was created to explain the relationship within the Trinity — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — dwelling within each other while retaining their distinct identities. Each contains the other, is contained by the other, in an endless circulatory indwelling. Without hierarchy, without separation, yet without confusion.

**The relationship between body and mind is exactly this.**

- The body dwells within the mind — because bodily signals create emotions.
- The mind dwells within the body — because emotions regulate the autonomic nervous system and hormones.

They are not separated, yet they are not the same thing. They ceaselessly circulate within each other, constituting one another.

## From p-factor to e-factor

In psychiatry, the **p-factor** (psychopathologic factor) has long been discussed — a common vulnerability underlying diverse mental disorders. Its core question: *Why do people break down in so many different forms?*

We can extend this question to physical illness as well. Why does one person develop depression, another diabetes, another cardiovascular disease, another cancer and chronic fatigue? The names of symptoms differ, but is the underlying vulnerability really different?

My answer to this question is the **e-factor**.

The e-factor is not a supplementary concept for explaining exercise effects. It is the **counterpart to the p-factor** — an attempt to reinterpret all disease through the lens of **energy and connection (engagement)**.

> If the p-factor asks "why do we break down so easily," the e-factor asks "how is health generated despite everything?"

## Two Axes of the e-factor

### Axis 1: Energy — Mitochondrial Resilience

Every disease shares a commonality: **the inability to handle energy**.

This isn't simply about ATP production. It's about:
- Can energy be mobilized when needed?
- Can it be distributed efficiently?
- Can the body return to balance after stress?

This capacity is **mitochondrial resilience**. When it collapses, minor stimuli are interpreted as excessive stress, the autonomic nervous system locks into sympathetic dominance, and inflammation, hormonal imbalance, fatigue, and pain become chronic.

### Axis 2: Connection — Engagement and Oxytocin

But energy alone doesn't complete health. Living beings did not evolve to optimize energy in isolation. **Humans enter recovery mode only when they feel safe within connection.**

Oxytocin isn't simply a "love hormone." It lowers threat assessment, activates the vagus nerve, and shifts the autonomic nervous system from defense mode to recovery mode.

When safely connected, the body begins to invest energy in recovery and adaptation. When isolated and disconnected, no matter how much energy is supplied, the body won't invest it — it stays in standby mode.

**Between energy and engagement, there is also a perichoresis.** Energy stabilizes within connection; connection sustains through energy.

## The Paradigm Shift: From Mind-First to Body-First

This perspective challenges the dominant paradigm in psychiatry and digital therapeutics (DTx).

**CBT asks:** "Is that thought true?"

**Body-first asks:** "Given this body state, wasn't it inevitable that the brain would interpret it that way?"

This isn't merely a difference in technique. It's a fundamental shift in where healing begins.

Through physical activity, somatic exercise, and **imaginal anatomy-based movement** — where anatomical awareness guides movement quality — we can:

1. **Re-educate interoception**: Relabeling "bodily sensation = threat" to "bodily sensation = observable, regulable signal"
2. **Retune autonomic tone**: Shifting from sympathetic dominance to vagal activation through breath and rhythmic movement
3. **Change the quality of bodily signals**: When signals reaching the insula shift from "alarm" to "safety," the brain constructs a new emotional state

**The mind doesn't change through persuasion. It changes through bodily experience.**

## Conclusion: The Eternal Circulation of Mutual Indwelling

Eat well, move well, raise and lower your heart rate, breathe deeply. You are rewriting the letter your body sends to your mind. And the mind, having read that letter, will send a better reply back to the body.

Mental health is not a matter of willpower. Chronic disease is not a matter of failed management. **These are all matters of energy and connection.**

Healing does not begin in the mind. Healing begins in the body, and is completed when energy and engagement are restored.

And all of this happens within the perichoresis — the endless mutual indwelling of body and mind.
